* Use the Attribute Definition resource to manage the properties, options, and extras that uniquely describe products of a specific type. Attributes can be associated with a product type, assigned values by a client or shopper, and added as faceted search filters for a product category. Options are product attributes that describe unique configurations made by the shopper, such as size or color, and generate a new product variation (or unique SKU). Properties are product attributes that describe aspects of the product that do not represent an option configurable by the shopper, such as screen resolution or brand. Extras are product attributes that describe add-on configurations made by the shopper that do not represent a product variation, such as a monogram.
